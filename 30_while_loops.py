# A while loop repeats while a condition is true

count = 0

while count < 3:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1  # Increase the value to eventually break the loop

# Example: using a while loop to ask for user input (uncomment to use)
# user_input = ""
# while user_input != "exit":
#     user_input = input("Type 'exit' to stop: ")
#     print("You typed:", user_input)
